Configuration
=============

Provided is an example pot.json file (example.pot.json). Copy this file to your project directory and adjust to your needs.
The table pot uses will be created if it does not exist.
The command to run must be as complete as possible, missing only the file to run against (represented by %s), eg:
 * echo %s
 * chmod 775 %s
 * /usr/bin/kettle/pan.sh -file=%s
All files in the directory listed will have the command run against. It is recommended to give these files a numeric filename, as pot will calculate the integer value of the filename to determine what order the files should be run
